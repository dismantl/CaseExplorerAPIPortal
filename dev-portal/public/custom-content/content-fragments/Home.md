### EXPLORE THE DATA
        
Welcome to the Case Explorer API Portal. Here you can interactively try out our REST API and see what endpoints are available. Read the Getting Started guide to learn how to use this API portal and manage your account. Sign in to manage your subscriptions, see your current usage, get your API Key, and test against our live API.

The Case Explorer REST API allows you to query any of the tables in our database of over 20 million Maryland court cases dating back to 2000. The main table is <code>cases</code>, which contains entries for all scraped cases of any format. For [case formats that have parsers available](https://github.com/dismantl/CaseHarvester/issues/10), you can see case details in secondary and tertiary tables (e.g. <code>dscr</code> and <code>dscr_charges</code>).
